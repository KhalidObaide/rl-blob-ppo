# Blob Game (Reinforcement Learning)
Reinforcement Learning algorithm applied on a custom terminal-based blob game.\
The Objective is to reach the target as early as possible while avoding the intended obstacles

### Setup & Usage:
1. Setup a virtual environment and install the required packages
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KhalidObaide/rl-blob-ppo.git
   cd rl-blob-ppo
   python3 -m virtualenv env
   source env/bin/activate
   pip3 install requirements.txt
   ```
2. Train the model ( Shouldn't take long! ):
   ```bash
   python3 train.py
   ```
3. See the trained model in action
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

### Results: (98%)
